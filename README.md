# StampyGame

Stampy is a game created using Scratch.

With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations â€” and share your creations with others in the online community.

The game is deployed and playable at https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/374053599/

To play the game, you move stampy up and down using your mouse (or swiping up and down on touch screens) and using spacebar (or pressing on the touch screen) to fire Stampy's peanuts at the attacking mice and bats. '

Don't let the mice or bats hit Stampy, or else points will be deducted.
